:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What quantitative analysis operations can be performed on data composed of literary 
texts?
- How can these operations be translated into Python code?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Learn how to perform word frequency analysis on literary texts.
- Learn how to visualize a word cloud from a text. 
- Learn how to perform keyword-in-context analysis on literary texts.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the previous episode, we worked with tabular data and performed three
core operations often used in quantitative humanities research: *counting*, *searching*,
and *visualizing*. In this episode, we'll apply similar operations to text
data. We'll focus on analyzing the full texts of plays written by two 
prominent English playwrights from the 16th century: William Shakespeare (1564–1616) 
and Christopher Marlowe (1564–1593). We’ll learn how to perform the following types of
analysis on these texts using Python:

1. Word frequency analysis
2. Creating a word cloud
3. Keyword-in-context (KWIC) analysis


Because text fundamentally differs from tabular data, we’ll take a completely 
different approach in this episode compared to the previous one, using distinct 
Python libraries and syntax to carry out analytical tasks. 

To save the data locally on your computer, go ahead and run the following Python code. 
It creates a directory named `data` in the same path where your Jupyter Notebook is 
located, if the directory doesn't exist already. Then, it downloads the directories
`shakespeare` and `marlowe` and their contents from GitHub and saves them in 
`data`. 

```python

import os
import requests

# Base URLs for each directory
base_urls = {
    "shakespeare": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/hermes_python_101_humanities/main/episodes/data/shakespeare",
    "marlowe": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/hermes_python_101_humanities/main/episodes/data/marlowe"
}

# Files to download
file_lists = {
    "shakespeare": ['alls_well_ends_well.txt', 'comedy_of_errors.txt', 'hamlet.txt', 'julius_caesar.txt',
                    'king_lear.txt', 'macbeth.txt', 'othello.txt', 'romeo_and_juliet.txt', 'winters_tale.txt'],
    "marlowe": ['doctor_faustus.txt', 'edward_the_second.txt', 'jew_of_malta.txt', 'massacre_at_paris.txt']
}

# Create 'data' folder and subfolders
os.makedirs("data/shakespeare", exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs("data/marlowe", exist_ok=True)

# Download each file
for author, files in file_lists.items():
    for file_name in files:
        url = f"{base_urls[author]}/{file_name}"
        local_path = f"data/{author}/{file_name}"
        
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            with open(local_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(response.text)
            print(f"Downloaded: {local_path}")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download {url} (status code: {response.status_code})")

```

For now, it's not necessary to go into details about how the above code functions. You'll learn more
about web scraping in later episodes. 

In Jupyter Notebook, save the path to each directory in a variable like this: 

``` python
shakespeare_path = './data/shakespeare'
marlowe_path = './data/marlowe'
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: caution
When working with text data, it's essential to *clean* the text before beginning the 
analysis. During this cleaning process, you will remove characters that indicate line 
breaks and other unwanted symbols that might affect your analysis. I've performed some 
minimal cleaning on the text data we will be using in this episode.

Unfortunately, we won't be able to cover text cleaning in detail in this lesson. 
However, you'll find a wealth of helpful video tutorials online that can guide you 
through the process of cleaning text data on your own.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 1. Word Frequency Analysis

Word frequency analysis is a foundational method in computational literary studies that 
involves counting how often individual words appear in a text or a collection of texts.
By quantifying language in this way, scholars can identify patterns, emphases, and 
stylistic tendencies within texts.

Word frequency analysis can serve several purposes in literary research:

- It can reveal recurring themes or motifs by highlighting which words are most 
frequently used, offering insight into a text’s dominant concerns or rhetorical 
strategies. 
- It can also be used to compare the linguistic style of different authors, genres, or historical
periods, helping to map changes in diction, tone, or subject matter over time.
- In studies of individual works, frequency analysis can assist in tracking narrative
focus or character development by examining how often certain names, places,
or concepts appear across a text.
- Beyond individual texts, word frequency analysis can also support authorship attribution,
genre classification, and the study of intertextuality. 

We'll explore which words were
most frequently used in nine of Shakespeare’s plays and four of Marlowe’s,
all included in our dataset. This analysis will help us gain insight into
the themes and rhetoric of some of the most influential English plays written
in 16th-century England.

### Step 1: Loading the Dataset into the Script

Unlike the previous episode, where the dataset was stored in a single `.csv`
file, the dataset for this episode is stored in thirteen separate `.txt` files.
To store multiple texts in a single Python variable, we can construct
a *Python dictionary*.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is a Python dictionary?

Python dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets: **{ }**.
A Python dictionary is a built-in data structure used to store pairs of related information. 
One part of the pair is called the *key*, and the other part is the *value*. 
Each key is linked to a specific value, and you can use the key to quickly access the 
value associated with it. A Python dictionary is structured exactly like a linguistic
dictionary: just as you look up a word in a linguistic dictionary to find its definition, 
you can store values under keys in a Python dictionary to be able to use the keys to 
retrieve the values later. 

Here’s how you might define a Python dictionary:

``` python
my_vacation_plan= {
    'budget': 100,
    'destination': 'Johannesburg',
    'accomodation': 'Sunset Hotel',
    'activities': ['hiking', 'swimming', 'biking'],
    'travel by plane': TRUE
}
```

In a Python dictionary, both keys and values can be a variety of data types, 
but with some important rules:

##### Keys:

There are two main things to know about keys:

1. They must be unique: You can’t have two identical keys in the same dictionary.
2. They must be immutable: This means they have to be data types that cannot change.

Valid key types include:

- Strings (e.g., 'budget')
- Numbers (e.g., 1, 3.14)
- Tuples (e.g., (1, 2)), as long as the tuple itself doesn’t contain mutable objects

You cannot use lists, dictionaries, or other mutable types as keys.

##### Values:

Values can be any type of Python object, including:

- Strings
- Numbers
- Lists
- Booleans
- Functions
- Even other dictionaries or complex objects

Python places no restriction on the types of values you can store.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We’re going to create two dictionaries: one for Marlowe’s plays, and one
for Shakespeare’s. The keys in each dictionary will be the names of the
`.txt` files — which correspond to the play titles — and the values will be the
full texts of the plays. First, let's build a list of keys for
each dictionary:

``` python
import os

shakespeare_files = [f for f in os.listdir(shakespeare_path)]
marlowe_files = [f for f in os.listdir(marlowe_path)]

print("File names corresponding to Shakespeare:")
for file in shakespeare_files: 
    print ("*", file)
print()
print("File names corresponding to Marlowe:")
for file in marlowe_files: 
    print ("*", file)
```

![](fig/output_13.png)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

In the above code, we're defining two lists: `shakespeare_files` and `marlowe_files`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is a Python list?

A list in Python is a type of data structure used to store multiple items in a 
single variable. Lists can hold different types of data like numbers, strings, 
or even other lists. Items in a list are ordered, changeable (mutable), 
and allow duplicate values- meaning that the same value can appear multiple times 
in the list without any issue. 

Python lists are enclosed in square brackets: **[ ]**. A Python list could look like this: 

```python
my_list = ['apples', 'oranges', 12, [4, 5, 6], 'bananas']
```
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```
import os
```
This line imports Python’s built-in `os` module, which provides functions for 
interacting with the operating system. This includes functions to work with 
files and directories.

```
shakespeare_files = [f for f in os.listdir(shakespeare_path)]
marlowe_files = [f for f in os.listdir(marlowe_path)]
```
This is a list comprehension, which is a short way to create a new list using 
a `for` loop.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is a for loop?

A for loop is used in Python to repeat an action for every item in a group 
(like a list). You can think of it as a way to go through a collection of 
things one by one and do something with each item. Here’s a basic idea:

```
for item in group:
    do something with item
```

The loop takes one item from the group, does something with it, then moves on 
to the next, until there are no more items left.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

- `os.listdir(shakespeare_path)` calls a function named `listdir()` from the 
`os` module. It takes the path to a directory (given in `shakespeare_path`) 
and returns a list of all the names of files and folders inside that directory.

- `for f in os.listdir(shakespeare_path)` is a `for` loop. It goes through each 
item in the list returned by `os.listdir(shakespeare_path)`. For each item 
(each filename), it temporarily gives it the name `f`. So, `f` is a variable 
that holds each filename one by one. 

- The list comprehension `[f for f in os.listdir(shakespeare_path)]` basically 
says: "Take each `f` (each filename) from the directory, and put it into a new list."
That new list is then assigned to the variable `shakespeare_files`.

`marlowe_files` is another list that is created through the exact same process. 

```
print("File names corresponding to Shakespeare:")
for file in shakespeare_files: 
    print ("*", file)
print()
print("File names corresponding to Marlowe:")
for file in marlowe_files: 
    print ("*", file)
```

Having created these lists, we proceed to print their items one by one, again 
using a `for` loop. Notice how the `for` loop is being implemented here as compared 
to the list comprehension above. Can you see the logic behind its syntax?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In order to use the file names as dictionary keys, we need to get rid of their 
`.txt` extension. To do so, let's write a function that does exactly this for us. 
The function takes a list of file names, removes their `.txt` extensions, and 
returns a list of file names without extension:

``` python
def extention_remover (file_names):
    filenames_without_extention = [file.removesuffix(".txt") for file in file_names]
    return filenames_without_extention
```

Now let's apply the function to `shakespeare_files` and `marlowe_files` and store the 
results in two new lists, `shakespeare_works` and `marlowe_works`. We'll print the 
resulting lists to make sure that the file extensions have been successfully 
removed from them: 

``` python
shakespeare_works= extention_remover(shakespeare_files)
marlowe_works= extention_remover(marlowe_files)

print (shakespeare_works)
print (marlowe_works)
```

![](fig/output_14.png)

So far, so good! Now we can create dictionaries containing all the works
by each author. To do this, we'll define a function that handles it
for us. We'll also incorporate the earlier steps - specifically, reading file names
from a directory and applying the `extension_remover` function to strip their extensions.
This way, the new function can take the path to a folder containing
our literary works and return a dictionary where each file name (without the
extension) becomes a key, and the corresponding literary text becomes the value:

``` python
def literary_work_loader (path):
    
    def extention_remover (file_names):
        filenames_without_extention = [file.removesuffix(".txt") for file in file_names]
        return filenames_without_extention
        
    file_names= [f for f in os.listdir(path)]
    work_names= extention_remover (file_names)

    full_text_dict= {}
    
    for file, work in zip(file_names, work_names): 
        with open(f"{path}/{file}", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            full_text = f.read().replace("\n", "")
            full_text_dict[work]= full_text
    
    return full_text_dict
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

The first few lines of the above code are already familiar to you. So let's only 
focus on the part where we are creating a dictionary:

``` 
full_text_dict= {}
```

In this line, we are creating an empty dictionary and assigning it to a variable named 
`full_text_dict`. 

``` 
for file, work in zip(file_names, work_names):
```

This line sets up a `for` loop. It lets us go through two lists — `file_names` 
and `work_names` — **at the same time**. The `zip()` function pairs up each 
file name (with the `.txt` extension) and its matching cleaned-up name 
(with no `.txt` extension). So for each step in the loop:

- `file` will be the full file name (like "hamlet.txt"), and
- `work` will be the name without the `.txt` part (like "hamlet").

```
with open(f"{path}/{file}", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
```

This line opens a file so that we can read its contents.

- `f"{path}/{file}"` is an f-string that builds the complete path to the file. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is an f-string?

An *f-string* (short for *formatted string*) is a 
way to create strings that include variables inside them. It makes it easier to 
combine text and values without having to use complicated syntax.
Here's the basic idea:

``` 
name = "Bani"
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greeting)
```

Output: `Hello, Bani!`

The `f` before the opening quotation mark tells Python: This is a formatted string.
Inside the string, you can use curly braces { } to include variables (like `name`) 
or even expressions (like `1 + 2`).
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
If `path` equals "./data/shakespeare" and `file` equals "hamlet.txt", this becomes 
"./data/shakespeare/hamlet.txt".  
</div>

- `"r"` means we are opening the file in *read* mode (we are not changing it).
- `encoding="utf-8"` makes sure we can read special characters (like letters 
with accents).
- `as f` gives the file a nickname: `f`, so we can use it in the next line.
- The `with` keyword automatically closes the file when we're done reading it, 
which is a good habit.

```
full_text = f.read().replace("\n", "")
```

- `f.read()` reads the entire content of the file and stores it in a variable 
called `full_text`.
- `.replace("\n", "")` removes all the newline characters (`\n`) from the text by 
replacing them with a string with zero length, containing no characters (""). 
Normally, text files have line breaks. This line of code removes the line breaks 
and puts everything together in one big line of text.

```
full_text_dict[work] = full_text
```

This line adds a new entry to the `full_text_dict` dictionary.

- `work` is used as the key — that’s the cleaned-up name like "hamlet".
- `full_text` is used as the value — that’s the complete content of the file `hamlet.txt`.

```
return full_text_dict
```

This line returns the dictionary we built. Whoever uses this function will get 
back a dictionary with all the file names (without `.txt`) as keys and their full 
texts as values.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have the function, we can use it to create two dictionaries 
containing the works of Shakespeare and Marlowe: 

``` python
shakespeare_texts= literary_work_loader (shakespeare_path)
marlowe_texts= literary_work_loader (marlowe_path)
```

Try printing the `marlowe_texts` dictionary, which is shorter, to get an overview 
of its structure and content. 

### Step 2: Performing Word Frequency Analysis using spaCy

Performing word frequency analysis is faster and easier than you think. This has
become possible thanks to *pretrained machine learning models* that the Python 
library `spaCy` offers. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is a pretrained machine learning model?

A pretrained machine learning model is a model that has already been trained on
a large dataset by other developers. Instead of starting from scratch,
you can use this model to perform tasks like image recognition, language processing,
or object detection. It has already learned patterns and features from the data,
so you don’t need to teach it everything again. This saves time, computing resources,
and often improves accuracy, especially when you don’t have a lot of your
own data to train a model from the beginning. You can also fine-tune it
to work better on your specific task by giving it a smaller
set of relevant data. 
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We are going to use `spaCy`'s `en_core_web_md` model for this exercise. You can 
directly download the model from your Jupyter Notebook by running the following
code: 

``` python
! python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

Once you have downloaded the en_core_web_md model, it remains on your
computer, ensuring you don't need to download it again the next time you run
the following lines of code in Jupyter Notebook. 

Now, we will write a function that takes the full text of each play, tokenizes
it, and counts the number of times each word appears in that text.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What does tokenizing mean?

Tokenizing a text means breaking a piece of text into smaller parts — usually words, 
subwords, or sentences — so that a computer can work with it more easily.

In natural language processing (NLP), tokenization is often the first 
step when preparing text for most analysis tasks like word frequency analysis, 
language modeling, translation, or sentiment analysis.

The following example demonstrates how a sentence can be tokenized: 

```
text = "I love Python programming."
tokens = ['I', 'love', 'Python', 'programming']
```

In this case, each word is a token. However, more advanced tokenizers 
(like those in NLTK, spaCy, or transformers) can handle punctuation, subwords, 
and special characters more intelligently.

Tokenization is important in NLP because computers don’t understand raw text.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

``` python
import spacy
from collections import Counter

def token_count(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    words = [
        token.lemma_.lower()
        for token in doc
        if token.is_alpha               # Keep alphabetic tokens only
        and not token.is_stop           # Exclude stop words
        and token.pos_ != "VERB"        # Exclude verbs
    ]
    
    return Counter(words)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
Work with a partner and try to interpret the code above. Answer the following 
questions:

1. What do the imported libraries do? 
2. What does the function do?
3. Can you recognize the list comprehension in the function? How is is structured?
4. What Python object does the function return? What shape could it possibly have?

:::: solution
Let's analyze the code line by line and answer the above questions: 

1. `spacy` is a library that helps Python understand and work with natural language 
or human language (text). It can tokenize text, recognize parts of speech 
(like nouns or verbs), and more. `Counter` is a class from the `collections` module. 
It creates special dictionary-like objects that automatically count how often 
each item appears in an iterable, such as a list.

2. The function `token_count` processes a string of text and returns a count of 
specific words, excluding common words and verbs. Let’s break down what happens 
in the function step by step:

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">

``` 
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
```

This line loads `en_core_web_md`, the pre-trained machine learning model from 
`spaCy` that we have already downloaded, and assigns it to the variable `nlp`. 
This model has been trained on a large collection of English text and it can recognize words, 
their part of speech (like nouns or verbs), their base forms (lemmas), and more. 
We are assigning the loaded model 

``` 
doc = nlp(text)
```

Here, we use `nlp` to tokenize the text that is given to the `token_count` function 
as an argument. The result is a `Doc` object, stored in the variable `doc`. 
The `Doc` object represents the entire text and contains a sequence of Token 
objects. Each token is a word, punctuation mark, or other meaningful unit that 
the model has identified.

From there, the function filters and counts certain words from `doc`. 
We define which words these should be in the following list comprehension. 

</div>

3. 

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">

``` 
words = [
        token.lemma_.lower()
        for token in doc
        if token.is_alpha 
        and not token.is_stop 
        and token.pos_ != "VERB"
    ]
```

This list comprehension has the following structure: 

``` 
[token.lemma_.lower() for token in doc if ...]
```

It means:

- Go through each word (`token`) in the text (`doc`),
- Convert it to its lemma (basic form, like “run” instead of “running”),
- Make it lowercase,
- But only include it if it’s a word (no punctuation), not a stop word, 
and not a verb.

Stop words are very common words in a language — like "the", "and", "is", "in", 
or "of". These words are important for grammar, but they usually don’t carry much 
meaning on their own. In natural language processing, we often remove stop words 
because:

- They appear very frequently, so they dominate word counts.
- They don’t help us understand what the text is about.
- They’re similar across texts, so they’re not useful for comparing different documents.

We are also excluding verbs because, in performing this concrete word frequency 
analysis on the text of Marlowe and Shakespeare, we are more interested in nouns 
and adjectives, not in verbs. 

</div>

4. 

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">

The function returns a `Counter` object. This is like a dictionary where:

- Each key is a word,
- Each value is the number of times that word appeared.

So the shape is something like:

``` 
{'word1': 3, 'word2': 1, 'word3': 2}
```

</div>
::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We are now just one step away from obtaining the word frequencies in the entire
text collections by Marlowe and Shakespeare. While the `token_count` function
only counts words in a single text file, we have dictionaries that contain multiple
text files: four texts by Marlowe and nine by Shakespeare.

Therefore, we need an additional function that takes a dictionary — not just a
single text file — and counts the words in all the texts that exist as the values
of keys in that dictionary. This approach allows us to count words not in a
single text, but across a collection of texts written by a single author.

Writing this new function will be relatively easy, as we will integrate the
`token_count` function within it, which handles most of the work for us. 

``` python
def token_frequency_count (text_dict):
    
    def token_count(text):
        nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
        doc = nlp(text)
        words = [
            token.lemma_.lower()
            for token in doc
            if token.is_alpha 
            and not token.is_stop  
            and token.pos_ != "VERB"
        ]
        return Counter(words)

    total_counts = Counter()
    for key, value in text_dict.items(): 
        total_counts += token_count (value)

    return total_counts
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code's last lines

The `token_frequency_count` function contains the `token_count` function that 
we have written previously. After defining the `token_count` function, we are creating  
an empty `Counter` object (which has the structure of a Python dictionary) and 
assigning it to the variable `total_counts`. 

Then, we are iterating through the keys and values of the input dictionary, namely 
`text_dict`, using a for loop. The for loop does the following: 

- It treats each key-value pair as an `item`. 
- It goes to the first item using its key, and reads the value of that key, which 
is the full text of a play. 
- It uses the `token_count` function to create a `Counter` object containing all the 
desired words (`tokens`) from that text and adds that `Counter` object to `total_counts`. 
- Then it goes to the next `item` (key-value pair) in `text_dict` and performs the 
above operations again. It keeps counting words from every text in `text_dict` and adding
them to `total_counts` until it reaches the last `item` in `text_dict`. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's apply the `token_frequency_count` function to the dictionaries we have created 
from the Marlowe and Shakespeare texts and take a look at the frequency of words used in 
the texts written by Marlowe as an example: 

``` python
shakespeare_frequency = token_frequency_count (shakespeare_texts)
marlowe_frequency = token_frequency_count (marlowe_texts)

marlowe_frequency
```

![](fig/output_15.png)

The output above displays some of the most frequent words used by Christopher
Marlowe in the four plays we are analyzing.

In your Jupyter Notebook, also display the frequency of words used by Shakespeare
and compare both results.

As you can see, comparing the two results can be time-consuming and
unintuitive, as they are not displayed next to each other in Jupyter Notebook.

Therefore, in the next step, we will visualize these word frequencies to gain
a better overview of the contents of the texts written by each playwright.
This will also allow us to compare their linguistic styles and literary themes.

### Step 3: Visualizing Word Frequencies

We have already worked with the `plotly.express` module in the previous
episode, where we visualized dataframes. We will implement the same module
in this episode as well.

Let's write a function that takes a `Counter` object containing a dictionary
of word frequencies (`freq_dict`), the number of the most frequent words
to display in the graph (`top_n`), and the title of the graph (`title`)
as parameters. This function will create a bar chart of the frequency of the
selected words within the `Counter` object:

``` python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

def plot_frequencies (freq_dict, top_n, title):
    
    most_common = freq_dict.most_common(top_n)
    df = pd.DataFrame(most_common, columns=['word', 'frequency'])
    fig = px.bar(df, x='word', y='frequency', title=title, text='frequency')
    
    fig.show()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code's last lines

``` 
most_common = freq_dict.most_common(top_n)
``` 

This line gets the top n most frequent words from `freq_dict` and stores them in 
a list we have called `most_common`. This list contains *tuples* that look like 
this: **(word, frequency)**. So, for example, the value stored in `most_common`
for the top three words that appear in Shakespeare plays would be:

`[('thou', 1136), ('shall', 759), ('thy', 725)]`

#### What is a tuple?

A tuple in Python is a collection data type used to store multiple items in a single 
variable, characterized by its immutability, meaning that once created, its contents 
cannot be changed; it maintains the order of elements, ensuring they appear in the 
same sequence as defined; and it can contain heterogeneous data types, allowing for 
integers, strings, and even other tuples within a single tuple. Tuples are defined 
using parentheses and commas, such as in the example: `(1, "apple", 3.14, True)`.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

``` 
df = pd.DataFrame(most_common, columns=['word', 'frequency'])
``` 

This turns the `most_common` list into a dataframe using `pandas` and stores the dataframe 
in a variable named `df`. It gives the columns the names 'word' and 'frequency'. 
The dataframe format is what `plotly` expects when making a chart.

``` 
fig = px.bar(df, x='word', y='frequency', title=title, text='frequency')
fig.show()
``` 

The first line creates a bar chart using the `express` module from the `plotly` library. 
It takes the following arguments:

- `df`: the dataframe created in the previous line
- `x='word'`: words go on the x-axis
- `y='frequency'`: their counts go on the y-axis
- `title=title`: the chart gets the title that is passed to the function.
- `text='frequency'`: shows word frequencies above the bars for clarity

Finally, `fig.show()` displays the chart in Jupyter Notebook. 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have the function, let's pass the necessary arguments to it and visualize
two bar charts displaying the 20 most frequent words that appear in the Marlowe and 
Shakespeare plays: 

``` python
plot_frequencies(shakespeare_frequency, 20, "Top 20 Words in Shakespeare's Works")
plot_frequencies(marlowe_frequency, 20, "Top 20 Words in Marlowe's Works")
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
In a group, interpret the bar charts you have just visualized:

- What information do these word frequencies reveal about the content and
style of the plays written by the two selected playwrights?

- Are there any common words among the 20 most frequent words from the
works of each playwright? What do these commonalities indicate about the
style of English playwrights from the 16th century?

- Do you think this observation can be generalized to all 16th-century
authors from England? Why or why not?

## 2. Creating a Word Cloud

Another way to visualize the most frequent words in a text is by creating a
word cloud. Word clouds are visual representations of 
text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency.

There is a specific Python library named `WordCloud` that does
exactly this for you. To visualize a word cloud, we will use single texts rather than the entire
text collection by each author. Let's write code that visualizes a word cloud
for Shakespeare's early play, "Comedy of Errors":

``` python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

text = shakespeare_texts['comedy_of_errors']

wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off') 
plt.show()
```
![](fig/output_18.png)

:::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

In this analysis, only lines of code are included that may be new to you.

``` 
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```
Here, we are importing the `WordCloud` class from the `wordcloud` library. This library 
is specifically designed to create word clouds.

``` 
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)
```

In this line, we create an instance of the `WordCloud` class with specific parameters:

- `width=800`: Sets the width of the word cloud image to 800 pixels.
- `height=400`: Sets the height of the word cloud image to 400 pixels.
- `background_color='white'`: Sets the background color of the word cloud to white.

The `.generate(text)` method takes the `text` variable (which contains the Shakespeare play) 
and generates the word cloud based on the frequency of words in that text. 
The result is stored in the variable `wordcloud`.

``` 
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
```

This line creates a new figure for plotting with a specified size. The `figsize` parameter 
sets the dimensions of the figure to 10 inches wide and 5 inches tall.

``` 
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
```

Here, we use the `imshow` function to display the generated word cloud image. The 
`interpolation='bilinear'` argument is used to improve the appearance of the image 
by smoothing it, which can make it look better when resized.

``` 
plt.axis('off')
```

This line turns off the axes of the plot. By default, plots have axes that show the 
scale, but for a word cloud, we typically want to hide these axes to focus on the 
visual representation of the words.

#### Reflect

Look again at the word cloud we have created. Can you identify the names of
the play's main characters?

## 3. Keyword-in-Context (KWIC) Analysis

In the previous section on word frequency analysis, we saw that counting the frequency
of words in a body of work can provide some information on the style and themes of 
literary works written by certain authors or in a certain epoch. 

These words and their contribution to style and meaning can be analyzed even more 
effectively if you look at the context they appear in. Keyword-in-context (kwic) analysis 
allows you to automate the search for the context in which each word appears. 

In this section, I'm going to present you with a simple code that does exactly this
for you:

``` python
import nltk
from nltk.text import Text
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')      #run this line only once and then comment it out. 

def kwic_analyze (text, keyword, width=140, lines=20):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    nltk_text = Text(tokens)
    nltk_text.concordance(keyword, width=width, lines=lines)
    
kwic_analyze (marlowe_texts['jew_of_malta'], "lord", width=120, lines= 20)
```

#### Can you tell how the above code works?

If you have studied this Python lesson from the very beginning and mastered
the concepts and methods from Episode 1 up to this point, you should be able
to understand what the above code does.

Experiment with the arguments you are passing to the `kwic_analyze` function
and observe the output. What does each argument do within the function?

:::: solution
```
import nltk
```
This imports the Natural Language Toolkit (`NLTK`) library. `NLTK` is a popular Python 
library for processing and analyzing natural language (text).

```
from nltk.text import Text
```
This imports the `Text` class from the `nltk.text` module. The `Text` class provides useful tools 
for analyzing text, including functions like `concordance()` for keyword-in-context 
(KWIC) analysis.

```
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
```
This imports the `word_tokenize` function from `NLTK`. It tokenizes a string of text 
by breaking it into individual words and punctuation marks.

```
nltk.download('punkt')
```
This downloads the `punkt` tokenizer model, which `word_tokenize` depends on to split 
text into words. Once you have downloaded this model, you can comment out this line of 
code because you don't need it any more. 

```
def kwic_analyze (text, keyword, width=140, lines=20):
```
This defines a function named `kwic_analyze` that takes four parameters:

- `text`: the full text you want to search
- `keyword`: the word you want to find in context
- `width`: how many characters of context to show around the keyword (default is 140)
- `lines`: how many keyword matches to display (default is 20)

```
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
```
This breaks the input text into a list of tokens,  using the `word_tokenize` function.

```
nltk_text = Text(tokens)
```
This creates an `nltk.Text` object from the list of tokens. This object lets you use 
text analysis methods, such as `concordance()`.

```
nltk_text.concordance(keyword, width=width, lines=lines)
```
This searches the text for the given keyword and displays each occurrence in context.

- `width` controls how much surrounding text is shown.
- `lines` limits how many matches to show.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
#### Challenge

Can you write a function that takes the dictionary containing all works by an author — 
instead of taking only one text — as well as the keyword, width of the context, 
and number of lines, and returns that keyword in the context of each one of the 
texts within the dictionary? You can integrate the `kwic_analyze` function 
from above into the function that you are writing. 

:::: solution
``` python
import nltk
from nltk.text import Text
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

def kwic_analyze_all(texts_dict, keyword, width=140, lines=20):
    def kwic_analyze(text, keyword, width=width, lines=lines):
        tokens = word_tokenize(text)
        nltk_text = Text(tokens)
        nltk_text.concordance(keyword, width=width, lines=lines)
    
    for title, text in texts_dict.items():
        print(f"\nContext for '{keyword}' in '{title}':")
        print()
        kwic_analyze(text, keyword, width, lines)
```

:::::::::::::::: callout
#### Reflect

Examine other plays by both authors and display the keyword "lord" in its
context within these texts. Does the word, in each context, refer to "God,"
or is it used to address a person of higher social rank?

Is there a relationship between these use cases and the genre and topic of the
plays?
::::::::::::::::::

KWIC analysis allows you to see the context in which each keyword appears.
It is helpful when you want to quickly examine the texts you are analyzing and
the context of individual keywords without performing a close reading of the text.

If these contexts seem relevant to you as a researcher, you can consider reading
the entire text to gain an even better understanding of the contexts of the
keywords on which your research is focused.
