## 1. Basics of Network Analysis

### What are Network Science and Network Analysis?

**Network Science** is an interdisciplinary field that studies complex networks, which are 
structures comprised of interconnected nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links). 
These networks can represent various real-world systems such as social networks 
(for example on social media), transportation networks, biological networks, 
and more. The aim of network science is to understand the topological structure of networks 
and the relationships that can be discovered within them.

**Network Analysis** refers to the methods and techniques used to study and evaluate 
networks. It involves identifying patterns, measuring node importance, analyzing connectivity, 
and understanding the underlying structure and function of the network. 

### When and With Which Type of Data is Network Analysis Useful?

Network analysis is particularly useful when the data can be represented as relationships or 
interactions between entities. Any type of data with this quality can be transformed into network
data. Network data is nothing but a tabular dataset with at least two columns: a `source` column and 
a `target` column. Each of these columns contains the names of the entities that are connected to 
each other in the network. Other columns can contain more information about the connection between
`source` and `target`, including the weight of this connection (identifying how strong it is) or its
type (for example, whether it is a connection between a human and a work of art, or one between 
two humans). 

In a visualized network, the sources and targets (usually represented by dots in the graph) are called
`nodes`, and the lines connecting them are called `edges`.

### Major Types of Networks

There are many different network types. Familiarity with them helps you decide in the future, 
when working with your own data, what network type your data can be converted to in order to optimally 
analyze its different features. 

Some important network types include: 

**1. Directed vs. Undirected Networks**

- Directed Networks: In these networks, the edges have a direction, indicating a one-way 
relationship between nodes. For example, in a citation network, if Paper A cites Paper B, 
the link goes from A to B but not necessarily in the reverse direction.

- Undirected Networks: Here, the edges do not have a direction, representing a symmetric 
relationship. An example would be a friendship network where two people are friends with 
each other, and the relationship is mutual.

**2. Weighted vs. Unweighted Networks**

- Weighted Networks: In weighted networks, edges have weights assigned to them, indicating 
the strength or capacity of the relationship. For instance, in a transportation network, 
the weights could represent distances or travel times.

- Unweighted Networks: These networks have edges that are simply present or absent, with no 
additional information about the strength of connections. An example is a simple social 
network where the only consideration is whether or not a connection exists.

**3. Bipartite Networks**

Bipartite networks consist of two distinct sets of nodes, and edges only connect nodes from 
different sets. An example is a movie recommendation system, where one set consists of users 
and the other set consists of movies.

**4. Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Networks**

- Homogeneous Networks: These networks consist of nodes of the same type. An example is a 
social network where all nodes represent people.

- Heterogeneous Networks: In these networks, nodes can represent different types of entities. 
For instance, a scientific citation network can include papers, authors, and journals as 
different types of nodes.

## 2. Visualizing Network Data

As mentioned above, network data is a specific form of tabular data. For the analyses in this lesson, 
I have extracted some network data from the website of 
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), using the programming language SPARQL. 
For this lesson, it is not necessary to understand how SPARQL works. 

The dataset is stored in a CSV file. It represents a table composed of two columns: `source` 
and `target`. Both columns contain names of mostly European personalities. This table was 
constructed to represent a directional network, meaning that the philosophers and thinkers that 
appear in the `source` column have influenced the work of those in the `target` column. 

To construct this dataset, I have searched Wikidata for people whose work has been influenced by
Karl Marx, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Benedictus de Spinoza, René Descartes,
Plato, or Aristotle, as well as those who have influenced the work of these
philosophers. Therefore, these seven personalities make up the most important nodes in the network. 

Let's read the data into Jupyter Notebook, convert it to a Pandas dataframe, and display a sample of 
that dataframe with ten rows: 

``` python
import pandas as pd

data_url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/hermes_python_101_humanities/main/episodes/data/influence_network.csv'
influence_df = pd.read_csv(data_url)
influence_df.sample(10)
```

![](fig/output_19.png)

Now let's write some Python code that visualizes the network graph for us: 


``` python
import networkx as nx
from pyvis.network import Network

# Step 1: Build the NetworkX graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add nodes
all_nodes = set(influence_df['source']).union(set(influence_df['target']))
G.add_nodes_from(all_nodes)

# Add edges
for _, row in influence_df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['source'], row['target'])

# Step 2: Create a PyVis network
net = Network(directed=True, height='1000px', width='100%')

# Import the NetworkX graph
net.from_nx(G)

# Step 3: Apply your original visual styling

highlighted = {
    'Karl Marx',
    'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel',
    'Immanuel Kant',
    'Benedictus de Spinoza',
    'René Descartes',
    'Plato',
    'Aristotle'
}

for node in net.nodes:
    if node['id'] in highlighted:
        node['color'] = 'orangered'
    else:
        node['color'] = 'slategrey'

for edge in net.edges:
    edge['color'] = 'darkseagreen'
    edge['arrows'] = 'to'

# Step 4: Save output
net.save_graph("influence_network.html")
print("FINISHED! Network saved as 'influence_network.html'.")
```

![](fig/output_20.png)

Don't worry if the network that you have visualized in your code doesn't look exactly like the one
displayed here. `Pyvis` creates interactive network graphs, so that you can pull the nodes around
with the mouse and change their constellation. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

First, let's look at what is happening at each step: 

1. Build the `NetworkX` graph: Creates a directed graph `G`, collects unique node names from 
`influence_df`, and adds directed edges from source → target.
2. Create a `PyVis` network: Builds an interactive visualization object net (browser-friendly) 
and imports the `NetworkX` graph into it.
3. Apply visual styling: Colors a chosen set of important nodes (highlighted) differently, 
sets a color and arrow style for every edge.
4. Save output: Writes the interactive HTML file `influence_network.html` and prints a short 
completion message.

Now, let's look more deeply into what each code chunk does: 

```
import networkx as nx
from pyvis.network import Network
```
Imports the `NetworkX` library under the name `nx` — used for building and manipulating graphs.
Imports `Network` from `PyVis`, a class for creating interactive network visualizations that open 
in a browser.

```
# Step 1: Build the NetworkX graph
G = nx.DiGraph()
```
Creates an empty directed graph object `G` (edges have direction).

```
# Add nodes
all_nodes = set(influence_df['source']).union(set(influence_df['target']))
```
Collects all unique node names: takes the `source` column and `target` column from `influence_df`, 
converts each to a set, and unions them so each node appears once. 

```
G.add_nodes_from(all_nodes)
```
Adds every element of `all_nodes` as a node in the graph `G`.

```
# Add edges
for _, row in influence_df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(row['source'], row['target'])
```
Loops over each row of `influence_df`. For each row, reads source and target and adds a directed 
edge from `source` to `target` in `G`. (_ ignores the row index returned by `iterrows()`.)

```
# Step 2: Create a PyVis network
net = Network(directed=True, height='1000px', width='100%')
```
Creates a `PyVis` Network instance `net`. `directed=True` ensures arrows are shown for direction; 
height/width set how big the visualization will appear in the browser.

```
# Import the NetworkX graph
net.from_nx(G)
```
Converts the `NetworkX` graph `G` into the `PyVis` object `net`, copying nodes and edges so `PyVis` 
can render them interactively.

```
# Step 3: Apply your original visual styling
highlighted = {
    'Karl Marx',
    'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel',
    'Immanuel Kant',
    'Benedictus de Spinoza',
    'René Descartes',
    'Plato',
    'Aristotle'
}
```
Defines a Python `set` named `highlighted` containing node labels that should receive special visual 
styling (these are the seven featured philosophers mentioned earlier).

```
for node in net.nodes:
    if node['id'] in highlighted:
        node['color'] = 'orangered'
    else:
        node['color'] = 'slategrey'
```
Iterates each node in the `PyVis` representation. In `PyVis`, each item in `net.nodes` is a dictionary 
describing one visual node in the interactive network. It contains all the display attributes 
`PyVis` needs to render that node in the browser. Each dictionary represents one node in your network, 
including:
- the node’s internal ID (usually the label from the NetworkX graph)
- the text shown next to the node
- visual settings such as size, color, shape, and physics behavior

In each iteration, if the node's id (its label) is in `highlighted`, sets its color to 'orangered', 
otherwise sets it to 'slategrey'. This changes node appearance in the HTML output.

```
for edge in net.edges:
    edge['color'] = 'darkseagreen'
    edge['arrows'] = 'to'
```
Iterates every edge (each is a dictionary, similar to `net.nodes`). Sets the edge color to 
'darkseagreen' and ensures an arrowhead points from source to target by setting 'arrows' to 'to'.

```
# Step 4: Save output
net.save_graph("influence_network.html")
```
Writes the interactive visualization to the file `influence_network.html`. Opening that file in a 
browser shows the network with the applied styling.

Visualizing network data is very helpful, because it helps you understand the dataset better and decide
what insights it can offer you in your research. 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Study the visualized graph more closely. This is a directional graph of influence in the realm  of 
European philosophy. With a partner, discuss what questions the visualized dataset can answer. 
These questions guide the further analytic actions that we will undertake in this lesson. 

:::: solution

Below are some of the questions that we could answer using this dataset: 

1. Among the seven highlighted thinkers based on whom the dataset has been curated, which one has 
been more influential? Which one has had the least among of influence? 
2. Which thinkers have been influenced by the largest number of the highlighted thinkers? 
3. How can the influence of the highlighted thinkers be quantitatively measured? 

::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In the following sections, we will answer the questions above using different network analysis techniques. 

## 3. Measuring the out-degree

The out-degree of a node is the number of arrows going out from that node. In our influence graph, if 
a philosopher is connected to many others with arrows pointing from them to others, that means they 
influenced many people. So: 

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
out-degree = how many people a thinker influenced (according to our dataset).
</div>

Let's write a python code that calculates the out-degree of the highlighted seven thinkers: 

``` python
# List of highlighted thinkers
highlighted = [
    'Karl Marx',
    'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel',
    'Immanuel Kant',
    'Benedictus de Spinoza',
    'René Descartes',
    'Plato',
    'Aristotle'
]

# Compute integer out-degree safely
influence_counts = {}

for thinker in highlighted:
    influence_counts[thinker] = int(G.out_degree(thinker))

# Identify most and least influential
most_influential = max(influence_counts, key=lambda k: influence_counts[k])
least_influential = min(influence_counts, key=lambda k: influence_counts[k])

print("Influence counts among highlighted thinkers:")
for k, v in influence_counts.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v}")

print("\nMost influential thinker:", most_influential)
print("Least influential thinker:", least_influential)
```

![](fig/output_21.png)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

``` 
highlighted = [
    'Karl Marx',
    'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel',
    'Immanuel Kant',
    'Benedictus de Spinoza',
    'René Descartes',
    'Plato',
    'Aristotle'
]
```
This line re-defines the `highlighted` list from the previous code chunk. The list will be used 
to loop through these thinkers later.

``` 
influence_counts = {}
```
This line creates an empty dictionary called `influence_counts`.

``` 
for thinker in highlighted:
    influence_counts[thinker] = int(G.out_degree(thinker))
```
These lines create a For loop. The loop goes through the `highlighted` list one thinker at a time.
During each cycle, the variable `thinker` holds one name from the list.

`influence_counts[thinker] = int(G.out_degree(thinker))` retrieves the thinker's out-degree from the 
graph `G`. 

`G.out_degree(thinker)` returns how many edges point outward from that thinker.

`int(...)` ensures that the result is stored as a plain integer.

The dictionary `influence_counts` stores this value under the thinker's name.

``` 
most_influential = max(influence_counts, key=lambda k: influence_counts[k])
```
This line finds the thinker with the highest out-degree. `max(...)` selects the key (the thinker) 
whose value in the dictionary is largest.

`key=lambda k: influence_counts[k]` uses a lambda function that tells Python to compare items based on 
their stored influence number.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler
#### What is a lambda function?

A lambda function in Python is a very small, short function that you create without giving it a name.
Because it has no name, it is called an *anonymous* function.

It is used when you need a simple function for a short amount of time and do not want to write a 
full function with `def`.

A simple lambda function looks like this:

``` 
lambda x: x + 1
```

This means:

- take an input called x
- return x + 1

So if you used it like this:

```
f = lambda x: x + 1
```

then `f(5)` would return 6.  

In our code, we have: 

```
key=lambda k: influence_counts[k]
```

This means:

- Python is given a tiny function
- The function takes one input, `k`
- The function returns `influence_counts[k]```

In other words, when Python tries to find the maximum value in the dictionary, it uses the lambda 
function to tell it: “Look up the value for each thinker and compare those values.”

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

``` 
least_influential = min(influence_counts, key=lambda k: influence_counts[k])
```
This line works the same way as the previous one, but uses `min(...)` to find the smallest out-degree.
The result is the thinker who influenced the fewest people in the dataset.

Finally, the  last code lines implement functions that you have already learned in the previoius 
episodes.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

So far, we know that Karl Marx has been the most influential among the highlighted personalities in our
dataset, whereas the least influential person has been René Descartes. Let's draw a bar chart to better
understand the out-degrees of the seven selected nodes, which gives us a measure of how influential 
they have been in the world of philosophy and literature. 

``` python
import plotly.express as px

# Sort philosophers by out-degree (highest → lowest)
sorted_items = sorted(influence_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Unpack the sorted items back into two lists
philosophers = [item[0] for item in sorted_items]
out_degrees = [item[1] for item in sorted_items]

# Create bar plot
fig = px.bar(
    x=philosophers,
    y=out_degrees,
    labels={'x': 'Philosopher', 'y': 'Out-degree'},
    title='Out-degree (Influence Count) of Highlighted Philosophers'
)

fig.show()
```

![](fig/output_22.png)

In the above code, only the few first lines merit a brief explanation. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze a few code lines

``` 
sorted_items = sorted(influence_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```
`influence_counts.items()` produces all key–value pairs from the dictionary.
Each item looks like: ('Plato', 9) or ('Aristotle', 6).

`sorted(..., key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)` Sorts those key–value pairs based on the value 
(the out-degree). `x` represents one pair, such as ('Plato', 9). `x[1]` selects the second part of 
the pair, the out-degree.

`reverse=True` makes the list sorted from highest to lowest.

The result, stored in `sorted_items`, is a list of tuples ordered by out-degree. 

``` 
philosophers = [item[0] for item in sorted_items]
```
This creates a new list containing only the names of the philosophers, in the sorted order. `item[0]` 
means "take the first part of each tuple," which is the philosopher’s name.

``` 
out_degrees = [item[1] for item in sorted_items]
```
This creates another list containing only the out-degree numbers, in the same sorted order. `item[1]`
means "take the second part of each tuple," which is the out-degree.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 4. Measuring the in-degree

In the previous section, we measured the out-degrees. In this one, we want to measure the in-degrees 
to see which thinkers have been influenced by the largest number of the highlighted thinkers, which
translates into: which nodes have the highest number of arrows pointing at them.  We count, for each 
node, how many of its incoming edges come from the highlighted thinkers. 

Let's write a Python code that performs the in-degree count for us: 

``` python
# Step 1: Create a dictionary to count influences from highlighted thinkers
influence_count = {node: 0 for node in G.nodes}

# Step 2: Count how many highlighted thinkers influence each node
for target in G.nodes:
    predecessors = set(G.predecessors(target))  # thinkers influencing this target
    influence_count[target] = len(predecessors.intersection(highlighted))

# Step 3: Find the maximum count
max_influence = max(influence_count.values())

# Step 4: Find the non-highlighted thinkers influenced by the maximum number of highlighted thinkers
most_influenced_thinkers = [
    node for node, count in influence_count.items()
    if count == max_influence and node not in highlighted
]

print("Thinkers influenced by the maximum number of highlighted thinkers:", most_influenced_thinkers)
print("Number of highlighted thinkers influencing them:", max_influence)
```

![](fig/output_23.png)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
#### Let's analyze the code line by line

``` 
influence_count = {node: 0 for node in G.nodes}
```
`G.nodes` gives a list of all thinkers (nodes) in the network.

`{node: 0 for node in G.nodes}` is a dictionary comprehension. It creates a dictionary where each 
thinker starts with a count of 0, meaning initially we assume no highlighted thinkers influence them.

``` 
for target in G.nodes:
    predecessors = set(G.predecessors(target))  # thinkers influencing this target
    influence_count[target] = len(predecessors.intersection(highlighted))
```
`for target in G.nodes:` loops over every thinker in the network.

`G.predecessors(target)` gives a list of thinkers who have an arrow pointing to this thinker — 
in other words, thinkers who influenced them.

`set(predecessors)` converts the list of influencers into a set for easy comparison.

`predecessors.intersection(highlighted)` finds which of the influencers are in our highlighted 
thinkers set.

`len(...)` counts how many highlighted thinkers influence this node.

`influence_count[target] = ...` updates the dictionary with this number.

``` 
max_influence = max(influence_count.values())
```
`influence_count.values()` gives all the counts of highlighted thinkers for each node.

`max(...)` finds the largest number, i.e., the highest number of highlighted thinkers influencing 
a single thinker.


``` 
most_influenced_thinkers = [
    node for node, count in influence_count.items()
    if count == max_influence and node not in highlighted
]
```
The list comprehension `[node for node, count in ... if count == max_influence and node not in highlighted]` 
creates a list of thinkers whose count equals the maximum. It also makes sure that the nodes in this
list, whose in-degrees are being measured, do not belong to the highlighted list. 

The thinkers in the list `most_influenced_thinkers` are those influenced by the highest number of 
highlighted thinkers.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Wonderful! We now know that Michel Foucault, Alain, and Evald Ilyenkov have taken the greatest influence
from the highlighted thinkers. Let's now create a filtered network dataset, consisting only of these 
three nodes and the seven highlighted thinkers, and visualize it. This visualization should give us a 
better understanding of European philosophy's landscape concerning the seven highlighted thinkers: 

``` python
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx
from pyvis.network import Network

# Combine nodes to include in the smaller network
nodes_to_include = highlighted.union(most_influenced_thinkers)

# Step 1: Build the filtered NetworkX graph
G_filtered = nx.DiGraph()

# Add only the relevant nodes
G_filtered.add_nodes_from(nodes_to_include)

# Add edges only if both source and target are in nodes_to_include
for _, row in influence_df.iterrows():
    if row['source'] in nodes_to_include and row['target'] in nodes_to_include:
        G_filtered.add_edge(row['source'], row['target'])

# Step 2: Create a PyVis network
net = Network(directed=True, height='1000px', width='100%')

# Import the filtered NetworkX graph
net.from_nx(G_filtered)

# Step 3: Apply the same visual styling
for node in net.nodes:
    if node['id'] in highlighted:
        node['color'] = 'orangered'
    else:
        node['color'] = 'slategrey'

for edge in net.edges:
    edge['color'] = 'darkseagreen'
    edge['arrows'] = 'to'

# Step 4: Save the filtered network
net.save_graph("filtered_influence_network.html")
print("FINISHED! Filtered network saved as 'filtered_influence_network.html'.")
```

With a peer, study the visualized graph carefully and discuss what information it provides 
about European philosophy. 

## 5. Measuring centrality degrees

Finally in this episode, let's answer the third question we stated above: How can the influence of 
the highlighted thinkers be quantitatively measured? To do so, we can measure three so-called
*centrality degrees* for the nodes in the highlighted list. These are:

- Degree Centrality
- Betweenness Centrality
- Closeness Centrality

### Degree Centrality

**Definition:**

- Measures the number of direct connections a node has to other nodes.
- In a directed graph, degree centrality usually counts both incoming and outgoing edges unless 
specifically split into in-degree and out-degree centrality.

**Why we measure it:**

- It shows how “connected” a node is in the network.
- In a social or influence network, a thinker with a high degree centrality either influences many 
thinkers (high out-degree) or is influenced by many thinkers (high in-degree).
- It is a simple and intuitive measure of a node’s importance in terms of direct connections.

**Unit and Range:**

- Normalized unitless number that ranges from 0 to 1:

![](fig/output_25.png)

- 0 means no connections, 1 means connected to all other nodes in the network.

### Betweenness Centrality

**Definition:**

- Measures how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other pairs of nodes.
- A node with high betweenness acts as a “bridge” or bottleneck connecting different parts of 
the network.

**Why we measure it:**

- Identifies thinkers who are key intermediaries.
- Even if a thinker is not highly connected (low degree), they may control the flow of influence in 
the network if many shortest paths pass through them.

**Unit and Range:**

- Normalized unitless number that ranges from 0 to 1:

![](fig/output_26.png)

- 0 means the node is never on a shortest path between any two other nodes.
- 1 means the node is on all shortest paths (rare in real networks).

### Closeness Centrality

**Definition:**

- Measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network, based on the shortest paths.
- High closeness means a node can quickly interact with (or influence) all other nodes.

**Why we measure it:**

- Shows which thinkers are “centrally located” in the network.
- A thinker with high closeness can reach many others efficiently, making them influential even 
without high degree or betweenness.

**Unit and Range:**

- Normalized unitless number that ranges from 0 to 1:

![](fig/output_27.png)

- 0 means the node is very far from others (or disconnected).
- 1 means the node is as close as possible to all others (rare).

:::::::::::::::::: testimonial
At this stage, you should be at a point where you can understand the following code without any 
explanation. Congratulations! You're becoming a profi in Python programming!
::::::::::::::::::

Now that you know what information these centrality degrees reveal, let's measure them for the nodes
in the list of highlighted thinkers. 

``` python
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Calculate centralities
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)       
betweenness_centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(G)     

# Step 2: Collect centralities only for highlighted thinkers
data = []
for node in highlighted:
    data.append({
        'Thinker': node,
        'Degree Centrality': round (degree_centrality[node], 2),
        'Betweenness Centrality': round (betweenness_centrality[node], 2),
        'Closeness Centrality': round (closeness_centrality[node], 2)
    })

# Step 3: Create a pandas DataFrame
centrality_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 4: Sort by Degree Centrality (optional)
centrality_df = centrality_df.sort_values(by='Degree Centrality', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)

centrality_df
```

![](fig/output_28.png)

To develop a better understanding of the degree centralities in the dataframe, let's visualize them in 
a stacked bar chart: 

``` python
# Step 1: Transform the DataFrame to long format
centrality_long = centrality_df.melt(
    id_vars='Thinker', 
    value_vars=['Degree Centrality', 'Betweenness Centrality', 'Closeness Centrality'],
    var_name='Centrality', 
    value_name='Value'
)

# Step 2: Create a grouped bar chart with text above the bars
fig = px.bar(
    centrality_long,
    x='Thinker',
    y='Value',
    color='Centrality',
    barmode='group',
    text='Value',       # Show numeric values
    title='Comparison of Centralities for Highlighted Thinkers',
    height=700
)

# Step 3: Ensure all text values are horizontally above the bars
fig.update_traces(textposition='outside')  # Forces all values above bars

# Step 4: Customize layout
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title='Thinker',
    yaxis_title='Centrality (normalized 0-1)',
    legend_title='Centrality Measure',
    yaxis=dict(range=[0, 1]),
    template='plotly_white'
)

# Step 5: Show figure
fig.show()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion
Now that you know what each centrality degree means and you have the measures and graphs regarding
