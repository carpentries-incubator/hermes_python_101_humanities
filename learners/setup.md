::::::::::::::::::

## Datasets

In this lesson, we will work with multiple datasets. Each dataset represents a specific 
type of data that is suited to particular methods of quantitative analysis.

### Data for Episode 2 (Analyzing Tabular Data): Artworks from MoMA

The metadata for artworks in the [Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)](https://www.moma.org/) collection 
can be downloaded from the museum's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection). 

Since the data in this GitHub repository is continuously updated, we will be working with a 
version previously downloaded on April 9, 2025. This version is stored in the GitHub 
repository for this lesson, ensuring that the results you see during live coding match 
exactly what is demonstrated in the lesson.

To download the data from this lesson’s repository onto your computer, use the following URL:

```
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hermes_python_101_humanities/blob/main/episodes/data/moma_artworks.csv
```

### Data for Episode 3 (Analyzing Text Data): Plays by Shakespeare and Marlowe 

This dataset consists of the full texts of four plays by Christopher Marlowe and nine 
plays by William Shakespeare as follows. The Marlowe texts were downloaded from the 
website of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/410). 
The Shakespeare texts stem from 
[Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/download/).
Each play has been saved to a `.txt` file.

**Plays by Christopher Marlowe: **

- Doctor Faustus
- Edward II
- The Jew of Malta
- The Massacre at Paris


**Plays by William Shakespeare: **

- All's Well That Ends Well
- The Comedy of Errors
- Hamlet
- Julius Caesar
- King Lear
- Macbeth
- Othello
- Romeo and Juliet
- The Winter's Tale

You can download each set of works from the folders provided below: 

```

https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/hermes_python_101_humanities/blob/main/episodes/data/marlowe
```

### Data for Episode 4 (Analyzing Network Data): The Intellectual Influence Network

The .csv file that we will work with in this episode was derived from 
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). 
It includes the names of all individuals who either influenced Karl Marx, Georg Wilhelm 
Friedrich Hegel, Emanuel Kant, Benedictus de Spinoza, René Descartes, Plato, or Aristotle
or were influenced by them. 

To download the data from this lesson’s repository onto your computer, use the following URL:

```

## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Python and Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

To do the exercises in this lesson, you need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). We recommend you use 
Jupyter Notebook or cloud-based equivalent such as [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). 

If you're using Google Colab, you don't need any installation. Just create a Google account - if you don't have one
already -, create a new Colab Notebook by clicking on <kbd>New Notebook</kbd> in the above link, and start coding. 

Otherwise, to install Jupyter Notebook and Python on your computer together, we recommend using 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
To do so, click on your operating system from the list below and follow the instructions. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Windows

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/success with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda for Windows installer with Python 3. (If you are not sure which version to choose, you probably want the 64-bit 
Graphical Installer *Anaconda3-...-Windows-x86_64.exe*.)
3. Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer, using all of the defaults for installation *except* make sure to check 
**Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**.

This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA) can help you with the installation.

### MacOS

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/success with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for macOS (you can either use the Graphical or the Command Line Installer).
3. Install Python 3 by running the Anaconda Installer using all of the defaults for installation.

This [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U) can help you with the installation.

### Linux

1. Open https://www.anaconda.com/download/success with your web browser.
2. Download the Anaconda Installer with Python 3 for Linux.
(The installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the executable is downloaded (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`).
4. Type `bash Anaconda3-` and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete the full file name. The name of file you just 
downloaded should appear.
5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd> depending on your keyboard). You will follow the text-only prompts. 
To move through the text, press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>. Type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd>) 
to approve the license. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd>) to approve the default location for the files. 
Type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>Return</kbd>) to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
6. Close the terminal window.

After installing Python and Anaconda, make sure to install the Python libraries that we are using in this lesson. If you haven't installed Python libraries on your 
computer before, ask the instructors for support.
